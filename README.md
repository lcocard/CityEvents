# **CityEvents**

              This project was built using **Javascript**, **jQuery**,
              **Firebase**, **Google Maps** and **Google Places APIs**. The
              project uses the "Festival & Events Calendar" dataset from the
              Open Data catalog offered by the City of Toronto, Canada. The data
              was downloaded as a json file and imported into Google Firebase,
              being updated manually once a month. The user can search the
              database by date, the query result being a list containing all the
              events for that day, and some brief information about the event.
              With a click on a button the user can find the event location on a
              Google map. In a future update some more functionality will be
              added, for collecting demographic data about the people that are
              interested in those events (the form has been added to the web
              page but it is for presentation only).
